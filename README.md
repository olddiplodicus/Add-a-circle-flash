# Add-a-circle-flash
Wordpress plugin to add a circle 'flash' to the main picture of Twenty Seventeen theme

A 'flash' is an attention-grabbing element on the page; at the moment it's fixed to be a circle, with fixed text (editable in the plugin code, of course) with fixed colours. But with rotated text to make it look groovy. 

Also an attempt to add a box-shadow
